# Minecraft-Server-Discord-bot V1.1
A discord bot that starts a minecraft server using a command (-start)

You can also get your server's status using "-status"

Default Prefix is "-" but you can change it in index.js

feel free to use

note: If you want it to work you will need to go inside index.js and replace INSERTTOKEN by your bot Token, INSERTSERVERIP by your server's IP and INSERTSERVERPORT by your server's port (default is 25565). You will also want to make sure that the file starting your server is correctly (default is starterserver.bat)
